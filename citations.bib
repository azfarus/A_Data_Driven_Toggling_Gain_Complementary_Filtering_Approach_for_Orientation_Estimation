ABSTRACT = {Aiming at the problem that the accuracy of flight parameters calculated by the traditional flush air data sensing (FADS) and inertial navigation system (INS) complementary filter cannot meet the fine real-time control of the aircraft, a data fusion algorithm based on distributed inertial network and FADS is proposed. This method converts the inertial navigation parameters calculated by the distributed inertial network into flight parameters, and using the least squares fitting theory, the flight parameters are obtained from the pressure data measured by the FADS pressure hole. Then, by adjusting the filter constant of the complementary filtering algorithm, the flight parameters calculated by the inertial network are fused with the flight parameters calculated by the air data sensing to obtain high-precision flight parameters. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed filtering algorithm can keep the flight parameter estimation error less than 0.01 degrees throughout the flight phase. Compared with the traditional complementary filter, the estimation error of the proposed algorithm is smaller.},

ABSTRACT = {Normally, a three-dimensional orientation determination algorithm that is used in a magnetic and inertial measurement unit calculates the inclination (including both the pitch and roll) of rigid bodies by fusing the measurements of the gyroscope, as well as the measurements of both the accelerometer and the magnetometer. The measurements of the magnetometer can be helpful in improving the inclination estimation accuracy; however, once the measurements of the magnetometer are disturbed by ferromagnetic materials, the inclination estimation accuracy could be significantly decreased. Hence, a better approach should be followed in terms of not employing the measurements of the magnetometer for inclination determination. In order to achieve this goal, the component of the measurement of the magnetometer that is used for the improvement of the inclination estimation accuracy, along with the measurement of the accelerometer at each sampling time instant, is abandoned. Consequently, the remaining component of the measurement of the magnetometer, which is perpendicular to the measurement of the accelerometer, is used for the azimuth determination. After applying this process, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed for the inclination and azimuth estimations. Through experiments, the EKF is compared with three algorithms that were recently proposed with the same objective as this work, and the extracted outcomes show that the EKF approach clearly outperforms these three algorithms.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel magnetic angular rate gravity (MARG) sensor fusion algorithm for inertial measurement. The new algorithm improves the popular gradient descent (ʻMadgwick’) algorithm increasing accuracy and robustness while preserving computational efficiency. Analytic and experimental results demonstrate faster convergence for multiple variations of the algorithm through changing magnetic inclination. Furthermore, decoupling of magnetic field variance from roll and pitch estimation is proven for enhanced robustness. The algorithm is validated in a human-machine interface (HMI) case study. The case study involves hardware implementation for wearable robot teleoperation in both Virtual Reality (VR) and in real-time on a 14 degree-of-freedom (DoF) humanoid robot. The experiment fuses inertial (movement) and mechanomyography (MMG) muscle sensing to control robot arm movement and grasp simultaneously, demonstrating algorithm efficacy and capacity to interface with other physiological sensors. To our knowledge, this is the first such formulation and the first fusion of inertial measurement and MMG in HMI. We believe the new algorithm holds the potential to impact a very wide range of inertial measurement applications where full orientation necessary. Physiological sensor synthesis and hardware interface further provides a foundation for robotic teleoperation systems with necessary robustness for use in the field.}

ABSTRACT = {Inertial sensor-based step length estimation has become increasingly important with the emergence of pedestrian-dead-reckoning-based (PDR-based) indoor positioning. So far, many refined step length estimation models have been proposed to overcome the inaccuracy in estimating distance walked. Both the kinematics associated with the human body during walking and actual step lengths are rarely used in their derivation. Our paper presents a new step length estimation model that utilizes acceleration magnitude. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the experimental data for the derivation of the model. These data were collected from anatomical landmarks on the human body during walking using a highly accurate optical measurement system. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model for four typical smartphone positions for long-term human walking and obtained promising results: the proposed model outperformed all acceleration-based models selected for the comparison producing an overall mean absolute stride length estimation error of 6.44 cm. The proposed model was also least affected by walking speed and smartphone position among acceleration-based models and is unaffected by smartphone orientation. Therefore, the proposed model can be used in the PDR-based indoor positioning with an important advantage that no special care regarding orientation is needed in attaching the smartphone to a particular body segment. All the sensory data acquired by smartphones that we utilized for evaluation are publicly available and include more than 10 h of walking measurements.},

This paper presents a method that exploits the principles of directional cosines to setup a rotation matrix to deal with a closed loop PI feedback based model. The system uses a 9 degree of freedom (9DOF) sensor and exploits the benefits of the accuracy of a 3-axis gyroscope by leveraging the measurement of a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer, which compensates and corrects the accumulative drift generated by integrating the gyroscope velocity measurements. The results show that the method is relatively accurate with a small level of error when compared to vision based glyph recognition and tracking methods for self-localization and is a sustainable method for removing accumulative drift.},

abstract = {A practical inertial-measurement-unit-based method is proposed to measure the angle of a single-axis rotation, where the axis rotation is invisible or inaccessible. The proposed method utilises the angular velocities of an inertial-measurement unit (IMU) to compute the orientation of the rotating axis. An equation with respect to the unknown rotation angle is first developed due to that the attitude angles of IMU vary as the measured target rotates. An interpolation algorithm is proposed to solve the equation, and simulations are performed. Finally, with a turntable and an IMU, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Results demonstrate the robustness to initial noise and the effectiveness under different situations.The proposed method is practical because of its simple structure, flexible installation and applicability in complex environments. Another more contributions of this study are a feasible approach to measure the orientation of the rotating axis. This method solves the problem of complex and difficult installation of angle measuring equipment in specific environments. It is simple and suited for use in the real-time calculation of angular displacement. It can be used to measure the rotation angle of rotating motors or the rotating axis of some equipment.},

abstract = {The fact that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) move in a specific path and that the camera in the gimbal system mounted on the UAV adhere to the right target attracts the attention of many researchers. The effective control of the gimbal system directly affects the performance of the UAV which is tracking a predetermined moving target, following a specified path. The contribution of this study is not only modelling three-axis gimbal system mounted on mobile platform based on nonlinear Hammerstein block structure to control effectively using model predictive controller (MPC) but also improving real time target tracking performance under external disturbances. A novel Hammerstein model based MPC controller is successfully proposed for real time target tracking of three-axis gimbal system applying flight scenarios of UAV to be robust under external disturbances. In this study, firstly, the mathematical model of three-axis gimbal system mounted on UAV is developed based on traditional Newton–Euler method. Secondly, linear and nonlinear modeling based on the input and output data of the three-axis gimbal system mounted on UAV moving autonomously for target tracking is emphasized. The linear output error (OE) and nonlinear block structure Hammerstein models of the three-axis gimbal system are identified under the external disturbance effect, respectively. Then, the identified Hammerstein model is embedded in the flight control card, which included the three-axis gimbal system control to realize real time target tracking of the UAV. Afterwards, the MPC of three-axis gimbal system is realized under the external disturbance with linear and nonlinear models. Also, the performance of proposed MPC controller with Hammerstein model is evaluated comparing with conventional PID controller in terms of robustness and quantitative study of error analysis. Finally, the stability and robustness of the three-axis gimbal system controlled with the MPC algorithm has been investigated by the test results carried out in different scenarios. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed MPC algorithm with Hammerstein model in this paper can ensure that the UAV exactly tracking the target while maintaining stability, even with external disturbances.}
